Let's calculate the total time complexity of the code step by step, focusing on the operations inside the `main()` function. Here's the breakdown of each operation:

### Operations in `main()`:

1. **`NewIntArray()`** – O(1)

   - This creates an empty dynamic array.

2. **`ar.Add(3)`, `ar.Add(7)`, `ar.Add(6)`, `ar.Add(-2)`** – O(1) (amortized for each)

   - Appending elements to a slice takes amortized O(1) time, as explained earlier.
   - Since there are 4 additions, the total time complexity for these operations will be **O(1) + O(1) + O(1) + O(1) = O(4) ≈ O(1)** (since constants are dropped in Big-O notation).

3. **`ar.Sort()`** – O(n log n)

   - Sorting the array takes **O(n log n)**, where `n` is the number of elements. Here, `n = 4`, so the sorting step takes **O(4 log 4) = O(4 \* 2) = O(8) ≈ O(n log n)**.

4. **Loop: `for i := 0; i < ar.Size(); i++ { ar.Get(i) }`** – O(n)

   - The loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the number of elements in the array (4 in this case). Each iteration performs a **constant time O(1)** operation (`Get(i)`).
   - Total time for the loop: **O(n) = O(4) = O(n)**.

5. **`fmt.Println(ar)` (printing the array as a string)** – O(n)
   - Converting the array into a string requires iterating over all `n` elements. This operation has a time complexity of **O(n)**.

### Total Time Complexity

Now, combining all the steps:

1. **O(1)** for `NewIntArray()`
2. **O(1)** for adding elements (since we only added 4 elements)
3. **O(n log n)** for sorting
4. **O(n)** for iterating and getting elements
5. **O(n)** for printing the array

The largest term dominates the total time complexity, which is **O(n log n)** from the sorting operation.

### Final Total Time Complexity: **O(n log n)**

This is the time complexity for the entire code in `main()`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array (in this case, `n = 4`).
